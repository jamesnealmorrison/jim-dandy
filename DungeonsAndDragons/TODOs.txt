Goliath: Haven't implemented powerful athlete yet, because I won't often be doing jump or climb checks for now. But other than that Goliath should be 100% implemented.



Warden:
Need to finish implementing Font Of Life when I start having effects with saving throws.
Earthstrength is completely implemented and tested.  :-)
